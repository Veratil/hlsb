# Hyper Light Save Breaker

This is a simple save file editor for Hyper Light Breaker written in Python with a GUI wrapper in Python's tkinter.

Ideally this is for speedrunning to be able to set seeds and starting conditions for various challenges until Heart Machine implements such functions themselves and this editor becomes obsolete.

## Current Functions

* View Character Data
  * View unlocked skins
  * View equipped gear
    * View basic gear detail
  * Edit equipped Sycom attributes per skin
  * Edit items count
* View World Data
  * Edit world seed
  * Edit spawn position
  * Edit rezs remaining
* View Vault
* View EXEs
  * Edit EXE tier level unlocked
  * Edit EXE extra slots unlocked
* View found and unlocked Lore

## Future Functions

* Move and edit gear
* Edit locked/unlocked lore
* View stock of world vendors
* Anything else the community wants to implement

## Thanks

Thanks to Heart Machine for a fun early access game, and the fun I had decoding the save file (and continue to try to figure out some of the unknown data structures).
